Hi 👾

Welcome to one of the learning modules taught in Avalon.

This chapter focuses on **Computer Vision**, a topic that I personally spent a significant amount of time on especially the **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** part. Although I had been introduced to CNNs quite some time ago, back then I mostly understood *what they do* and *which libraries to use*, rather than *how they actually work*.

At one point, I was given the responsibility by the community to create a Computer Vision teaching module. Due to my primary responsibility as a college student, I could not fully focus on it at the time. Now, during the semester break, I finally have the opportunity to work on it seriously. So I decided to start from the fundamentals by revisiting **LeCun’s original paper on CNNs**. While it was a great starting point, it also made me realize how much I still needed to learn about what truly happens behind the scenes.

As the saying goes, *“you fail and you learn.”*  
This module is part of that learning process.

Please note that the visualizations in this chapter may still be limited. Since I am learning while writing, some explanations are presented conceptually first. Improvements and more detailed visualizations will be added over time. and learning CNN to the point where you can imagine every process is not that bad, because they serve as the backbone of many modern Computer Vision approaches, including Convolutional AutoEncoders (CAE), GANs, and Diffusion Models.



## Chapters We Will Discuss

This chapter consists of four main parts:

1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) => <a href="../CV/Topics/1. CNN/LeNet.md">read the main topics here </a>
2. AutoEncoder (AE) 
3. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
4. Diffusion Model  
   (with a focus on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models / DDPM)
