# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that studies vectors, vector spaces, linear transformations, and systems of linear equations. It provides the foundation for many areas of mathematics, science, and engineering.

This module will cover:
- [System of Linear Equations](./System%20of%20Linear%20Equations/)
- [Vectors and Linear Transformations](./Vectors%20and%20Linear%20Transformations/)
- [Determinants and Eigenvectors](./Determinants%20and%20Eigenvectors/)
