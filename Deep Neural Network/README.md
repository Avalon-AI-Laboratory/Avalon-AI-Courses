Welcome to the second module in the Avalon AI curriculum. This module covers the "magic" of getting deep learning to work well. We will move from building a basic model to building a high-performing

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand key mathematical and conceptual foundations for improving DNNs.
- Explore best practices for initialization, regularization, and optimization.
- Learn hyperparameter tuning and batch normalization techniques.
- Implement these techniques hands-on using TensorFlow and Keras.
